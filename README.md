# Pulse Your Life


## Our Purpose
We want to give an opportunity to all those who suffer cardiac problems to be comfortable and not to be 
afraid of suffering to heart attack, we propose to mobile application that shows real time stadistics and 
analytics about heart rate, if the user presents an irregular heartbeat we propose some physical activities to regulate it according to the heartbeat level, also if the user suffers to cardiac arrest we'll call an emergency ambulance and send a message to their trusted people selected by the user with the current user location.
