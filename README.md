# Pulse Your Life


## Our Purpose
We want to give an oportunity to all people who suffer cardiac problems to be 
comfortable and not to be afraid of suffering a heart attack, we propose a mobile application that shows real time stadistics and analytics about heart rate, if the user presents an irregular heartbeat we propose some physical activities to regulate it according to the heartbeat level, also if the user suffers a cardiac arrest we call an emergency ambulance and send a message to trusted people selected by the user with the current user location.
